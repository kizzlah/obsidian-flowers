	Create a full-featured alternative to GitHub that can function both as a standalone public website and a self-hosted platform. The service should offer customizable user accounts and integrated development environments (codespaces) with full containerization support for customizable cloud or local setups. It must support reading, rendering, and syntax highlighting for all major programming languages.
	Key features should include AI-powered code assistance for suggestions, auto-generation, and debugging; real-time live collaborative coding with integrated chat and video; advanced automated code translation between programming languages; and function-level read, write, and refactor capabilities powered by AI or scripting.
	Additional features should include decentralized, peer-to-peer repository hosting options for fault tolerance and privacy; integrated project management with Kanban boards, issue tracking, and CI/CD pipelines; a marketplace for reusable code modules and plugins; automated security and compliance scanning within pull requests; versioned, dynamic documentation with live previews; multi-language code review with language-specific linting; and support for managing nested repositories or microservices within a unified interface.
