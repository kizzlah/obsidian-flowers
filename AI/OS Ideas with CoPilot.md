Want help turning any of these into Notion templates or synced GitHub pages? I can also help you build a feedback loop that connects your UX research directly to your design system. Let’s make this OS not just organized—but *strategic*.

---
Building feedback loops between UX research and your design system ensures that user insights aren’t just stored—they’re *activated* across components, patterns, and decisions. Here’s how to architect that loop:

---

## 🔁 Feedback Loop Blueprint: UX Research → Design System

### 1. 🧠 Tag Research Insights by Component
Create a tagging system in your UX Research Vault that links findings to specific UI elements or patterns:
- Example tags: `Button`, `Modal`, `Form Field`, `Navigation`, `Card Layout`
- Use Notion relations or GitHub issue labels to connect insights to design system entries

> 💡 *Insight:* “Users struggle to locate the primary CTA on mobile.”  
> 🔗 *Tag:* `Button`, `Mobile Layout`, `CTA Placement`

---

### 2. 📌 Annotate Design System Components with Research Evidence
In your Design System Tracker, add a “Research Backing” field for each component:
- Include links to usability tests, survey results, or heatmaps
- Summarize the user pain point and how the component solves it

| Component | Research Insight | Design Decision |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Primary Button | Low visibility on mobile | Increased size, added icon, color contrast boost |
| Modal | Users confused by exit behavior | Added clear “X” icon and escape key support |

---

### 3. 🧪 Create a “UX Validation Status” for Each Component
Track whether each component has been:
- ✅ Validated by user testing  
- ⚠️ Needs testing  
- 🔄 Iteration in progress  
- ❌ Deprecated due to poor UX

This helps prioritize updates and ensures your system evolves with real user feedback.

---

### 4. 🔄 Automate Feedback Integration with GitHub or Notion
Use tools like:
- **GitHub Issues**: Link UX findings to component repos with labels like `UX-feedback`, `needs-validation`
- **Notion Relations**: Connect UX Vault entries to Design System pages, showing traceability

Bonus: Add a “Last Validated” timestamp to each component so you know when it was last tested.

---

### 5. 📣 Build a UX-to-Design System Review Ritual
Set a monthly or sprint-based review where you:
- Audit new UX research  
- Identify components impacted  
- Update design tokens, patterns, or documentation  
- Log changes in a “Design System Changelog”

This keeps your system alive and responsive to user needs.

---

### 6. 📊 Visualize the Loop
Create a dashboard view showing:
- Number of components backed by research  
- UX issues linked to design system updates  
- Validation status across the system

This gives stakeholders and devs a clear picture of how user feedback drives design consistency.

---

Would you like help building this out in Notion or GitHub? I can sketch out a relational database structure or even help you write a changelog template that ties UX insights to component updates. Let’s make your system *user-validated by design*.

---

Absolutely, Kyle — let’s build you a reusable Figma template that reflects your UX/UI precision, DevOps mindset, and branding sensibility. I’ll walk you through a modular structure that you can reuse across projects, iterate quickly, and even link to your design system or GitHub repos.

---

## 🧱 Step-by-Step: Build Your Own Reusable Figma Template

### 🗂 1. **Set Up Your File Structure**
Organize your Figma file into clear pages:
- `Cover`: Project name, date, client, version notes  
- `Components`: Buttons, inputs, nav bars, cards  
- `Layouts`: Desktop, tablet, mobile frames  
- `Patterns`: Modals, onboarding, empty states  
- `Prototypes`: Linked flows for testing  
- `Specs`: Dev handoff annotations and tokens

> 🔧 Tip: Use consistent naming like `btn/primary`, `modal/login`, `form/contact` for easy search and reuse.

---

### 🎨 2. **Create Core Components with Variants**
Use **Auto Layout** and **Variants** to build flexible, scalable components:
- Buttons: Primary, secondary, disabled, loading  
- Inputs: Text field, password, error state  
- Cards: With image, without image, hover state  
- Nav bars: Desktop, mobile, sticky

> 🧠 Bonus: Add accessibility notes (e.g., contrast ratios, focus states) in the description field of each component.

---

### 📐 3. **Design Responsive Layout Frames**
Build wireframe-ready layouts using:
- Desktop (1440 px), Tablet (768 px), Mobile (375 px)  
- Use grids and constraints for responsiveness  
- Include placeholder sections: hero, features, testimonials, footer

> 🧪 Add dummy content blocks like “H 1 Headline,” “CTA Button,” “3-column feature grid” for fast prototyping.

---

### 🔁 4. **Link UX Research to Components**
Create a “UX Notes” section in each layout or component:
- Add sticky notes or comment boxes with insights  
- Example: “Users missed CTA on mobile → increased button size + added icon”

> 🔄 This builds your feedback loop directly into the template, so every design decision is traceable.

---

### 🧪 5. **Build Reusable Patterns**
Design common UX flows:
- Login / Signup  
- Onboarding carousel  
- Modal interactions  
- Empty states and error messages

> 📦 Save each pattern as a component set so you can drag-and-drop into new projects.

---

### 📤 6. **Prepare for Dev Handoff**
Include a “Specs” page with:
- Typography tokens (font, size, weight)  
- Color tokens (hex, usage context)  
- Spacing system (8 pt grid, margins, paddings)  
- Export-ready assets with naming conventions

> 🧠 Add a “Last Updated” timestamp and link to GitHub if you’re syncing with code.

---

### 🧰 7. **Optional: Create a Starter Kit File**
Once your template is built, duplicate it and rename as `Starter Kit`.  
Use this for every new project so you start with:
- Pre-built layouts  
- UX-backed components  
- Dev-ready specs  
- Branding placeholders
